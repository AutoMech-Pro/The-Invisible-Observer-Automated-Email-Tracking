I have generated a complete, single-file HTML infographic (`n8n_infographic.html`) that visualizes the n8n email tracking guide. It uses Tailwind CSS for a responsive layout and "Modern Tech" styling, Chart.js for data simulation, and pure CSS/HTML/Unicode for all diagrams (no SVGs or Mermaid JS).

This video is relevant because it walks through the specific n8n workflow template visualized in the infographic, demonstrating the practical implementation of the concepts shown.
